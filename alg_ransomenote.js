// Time Complexity and Big O Notation

// Constant RunTime O(1) will only execute the same number of operations regardless of inputs

// Linear RunTime O(n) operations increase proportionally to the input ; o for function, n for size of the input

// Exponential RunTime O(n^2) evaluate all possibilities; for every added input, it takes an exponential jump; inefficient, slow, avoid

// Logrithmic RunTime O(nÂ²) Ex. Binary Search, Sorted, 2 inputs, reduces throughout the search by cutting the input in half
